BE test assignment


the .sh script is a result of various commands found online - seems like parsing data containing "/" does not work.

all in all, given I am not proficient in running shell scripts in Terminal, I hope my partially funcional code still counts, 
and that it at least shows I have a somewhat limited knowledge that definitely needs more work, which I am willing to provide
in th future.
